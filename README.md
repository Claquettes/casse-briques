# casse-briques
Minimalist Web-based breakout game by Mathieu Ponton (@Claquettes)
A Recreation of the classic Breakout game, created in Html, CSS and Javascript.    
The goal is to destroy all the bricks by bouncing the ball on the paddle.   
The player can choose to play differents levels, currently there are 6 levels, but I plan to make at least a dozen.   
It is hosted on my website to make it playable by everyone at claq.fr/casse-briques.
